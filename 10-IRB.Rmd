# IRB {#irb}

When you are considering doing research involving children, you will need the approval of the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of your institution. If this sounds unfamiliar to you, you can start by looking over the [Wikipedia entry for IRB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institutional_review_board). We will not be covering the basics of IRB requests here, but instead, we'll focus on information directly relevant to collecting long-form recordings.


## Basic information for all IRB submissions

When you specify the methods, you can state that recordings are gathered using a device that is attached to the child’s clothes, followed by automated annotations with speech technology tools. Include in your request information about how data will be transferred from the device to a storage unit, and from their to at least one back-up not in the same site. See the Storage video for more information. We strongly discourage you from saying that you'll collect the audiorecordings, analyze them, and then destroy them. This is because some of the risks that long-form recordings entail (security, discomfort at thinking about being recorded) have already happened, whereas several benefits can ensue from continuing to store and analyze the recordings (provided storage is safe and analysis is respectful, of course).

Consider also whether recordings will take place exclusively in the child’s home, or whether participants will also leave the home with the recorder on. In the latter case, your IRB may require you to provide evidence that you have checked that incidental recording is not against the law where the family lives. If it is legal, consider also how these data are going to be handled. Some researchers ask their participants to tell these others to get in touch with the researchers if they have questions. Others ask anyone who comes into contact with the device to read and sign a consent form.

You may be asked to specify why you are collecting the long-form recordings (e.g., collecting infant speech, investigating parental behavior, etc.) When doing so, please consider the fact that, when properly handled, these data can be incredibly rich and inform a variety of questions, all the while protecting the rights and well-being of participants. So unless there are strong reasons for you to specify a very narrow objective, then it is ideal to mention that recordings will be used for your research project as well as archived in scientific repositories for potential re-use for other research projects.


It is customary to include in an annex the actual consent form, or the consent speech used to explain the procedure to participants.

## Additional considerations

In some cases, it is desirable to have humans annotate part of the data, to check accuracy of the algorithms and/or to help develop additional algorithms and/or to complement with more qualitative small-scale approaches (see Annotations video). If you are planning on doing this, remember to mention this in your IRB request. Consider the training of annotators (including on the ethics of recordings) as well as how you may deal with unexpected discoveries (of illegal acts, child abuse, etc.)

In addition to in-lab annotations, you can also opt for citizen-science annotations. You can see an examples of this technique [here](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/laac-lscp/maturity-of-baby-sounds). In that study, we preserved anonymity of participants by extracting clips that were 500 ms long, and presenting listeners with clips extracted from many different children. This was possible because the decision we were asking for was very simple and could be taken with local information (e.g., who is talking: a baby, a child, or an adult?) An alternative that other researchers have selected is to have someone in the lab listen to sections of the audio and determine that there was no compromising information shared, and then these clips were annotated by citizen scientists for higher level content, based on listening to a whole sentence or even a whole conversation. If the latter seems interesting to you, then just make sure that your participants agree to this, since clips thus shared on Zooniverse become public. 

## Closing thoughts

This is a very short introduction to this important topic because there are already excellent resources available on this. Check out the resource section for links to consent forms and IRB request language.

## Resources

- You will find sample consent forms from several labs on https://osf.io/d4tcu/

- In particular, if the reuse for ExELang would be after you archive the data in a scientific archive, you can simply have a section where you ask whether they want to opt out of data donation - https://osf.io/5e3vz/ has an example of an opt-out check-box under point 2
- If you're uncertain about archiving, you can instead use the language under point 11 of the same consent form, the option is "Checking this box indicates my permission to store, use, and share my information from this study in research databases or registries for future research conducted by the current investigators and their research partners."
