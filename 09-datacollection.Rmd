# Data collection {#datacollection}

## Field conditions:

This video will focus on how to adapt data collection specifically to field conditions. First of all, by field conditions we mean cases in which you work far away from your usual lab, sometimes you won’t have a lot of access to water or to electricity (or both of them). The water is important when you need to wash your t-shirts, or any other kind of clothing you want to use for the hardware while electricity is fundamental for sure to recharge the devices used for data collection but also if you have some kind of in-the-field data annotation, this is also something to bear in mind.

So, in field conditions what we find very useful is to use clothing you don’t have to wash many times, so ideally you can also think to buy 1 t-shirt for participating family and then use a cheap device that you can clip on the t-shirt. This allows you to always leave the t-shirts with the parents once the recording is done. Another thing we found is that if electricity is a constraining factor, then USB are typically the best thing, because they consume so little energy. We have had some problems with charging them directly from panels, and so in the links you will find panels that we found would work with the USB device. So in particular we can tell you that using USB devices in field conditions, we were able to collect recordings for three days when there was no sun, and in the link section we give an example of the equipment we had and the time, so this just gives you an idea of the level of autonomy you would have vene in impoverished conditions. 

The other thing to bear in mind is how you are going to get the devices to and from different places. If you are using LENA, typically you will have set the time to the local time, so that’s fantastic because you will have the times of the recordings. If you are not using Lena, and you are using an USB or Olympus instead, often you won’t have a correct time stamp for when the recording started. We discuss this in the context of data collection because in the past sometimes we have given this task to local research assistants and they have provided the parents with a recording device and asked them to start the device at some point in the following day. This means you cannot have a specific record of when the recording was started and so that’s tricky because very often we do need to know the time samp in order to be able to interpret. Let me give you an example: it may happen that the parents forget to turn on the device and they actually only turn it on 1pm when you are in a place where the sun sets at 6pm and this means you’ll get 5 hours of daytime and then the rest of your recording will technically be at nightime and so, if you see lower levels of talking at that time it could just be that the family recorded at this time. 

The other thing to bear in mind with the USB is that the family can turn it on and off at any point in time and sometimes we have found that the USB do seem to have multiple files for reasons we haven’t understood, which could be families turning them on and off but it could also be for technical reasons that are beyond anyone’s control, and you can’t be sure what is the scope of the recording itself. 

Ideally you would want to deliver the recording device and write down what the time is. so one thing that you could do perhaps is the following:if you must leave the USB with the family, you can leave them a watch or some kind of clock and have them keep a record of when they started and stopped the recording. So, when you have these two edges, you can for instance non only know when the recording took place and adjust it to your quantitative estimates but also check whether there are any gaps in the recording based on if you are used to produce multiple files you can put them all together and make sure that this adds up to the same and if not, have an idea of how much time is missing between each of the files. 

## Logistics

In this video we are going to talk about logistics and how many devices you need for your research. We are going to focus on an urban setting because field conditions are discussed in another video. In the past, usually Lena devices were just dropped at the child’s home, and left with the parents; sometimes at the beginning of the day so that the parents didn’t need to do anything. I think that today, whether you are using LENA or another device, you don’t need to do this anymore, you don’t need to drop and pick up the equipment. You can instead mail it to the families or have it carried around in the local setting. If you are using USB or Olympus, you can ask parents to write down when they start the recording, so you can track the time. If you are using LENA or the BABYLOGGER you don’t need to ask anything at all because the devices have time stamping that are connected to the local time. 

So, what we found useful is providing parents with instructions on how to track time, we have booklets that remain with them and explain how the device works, how to turn it on, how they need to put it in the clothing and how they can just go about their day: this is useful because you can also have FAQs at the end, which will be informed by the things that the representatives of the community told you during piloting session. So the most frequent question that you get about how the data are going to be analysed, how they are going to be used for, etc. So anything parents told you in the piloting stage, you can have it in this little booklet. That said, the booklet is there and it is useful to some parents, but we are moving more and more towards complementing this with short videos that are accessible through a QR code that the parents can scan in the booklet and so in this case they can read the explanation or watch it. Particularly, regarding how to put the device in clothing, the booklet has pictures but nothing really replaces a tutorial video, so if you can do that, that would be really really great. 

How do you calculate how many devices you are going to need? So, this is also dependent on your goal and on the equipment you are going to use. If you are using the newest generation of LENA, that can hold up to three days and 24h straight recording without recharge, then we really do recommend recording all three days, because we have some initial evidence that when you have 3 days of recordings, the measurements are more reliable (more data are a better representation of what the child’s environment is like). This means you also need to provide parents with instructions on how to recharge the devices. So from the time you drop the equipment to the moment you pick it up, it is probably going to take 5 days, because you will drop the device the day before starting recording and you’ll pick it up the day after finishing. Also, we noticed that it’s not always easy for parents to launch the recording, and also, depending on your design, you might want to pick one week day and one weekend day, so in this case you might count that one device is going to stay with the family for one whole week. So that’s something to bear in mind. 

The same principle applies for the USB and the Babylogger because they can be recharged and used for multiple days. So, for instance, imagine you want to launch a study where you have 40 families participating and you want each family to contribute with one set of recordings per month from the ages of 6 months to the age of 12 months of the child. So in this case you will need at least 30 recording devices and 30 sets of t-shirts. This is because: imagine you have device 1 that goes with family 1 on week number 1. Then, you can use it with another family but probably it’s a little bit risky to use it on week number 2 so you will use it with family 2 on week number 3. This is because otherwise you would need to pick up the device, wash the t-shirts and drop the equipment off to the next family on the same day. 
(People who have been doing this in a large scale, they had cases in which a device gets thrown in the toilet or it gets crashed or the child jumps into a pool with the device on, so one should plan for at least one or two devices getting lost or broken.)
