# Alternative / Additional tests {#alternatives}

Some people have asked us: In order to measure language in young children, what else should or could I collect? This is a complex question to answer because it depends on what you are hoping to gain from them. We have compiled here ideas from a variety of sources, and we explain the reasoning for our recommendations, but this is definitely one point in which we think discussion would be most helpful. So don't hesitate to post comments in the chat or reach out to us. 

## If you want a standardized language assessment

A fantastic resource for measuring language (and cognition and development more generally) is the report by Fernald and colleagues published by the World Bank in 2009.

They explain that assessments should meet a variety of desiderata. Among them is the fact that they are "psychometrically adequate, valid and reliable". We have seen validity and reliability in Video \@ref(validreli)  

Balanced in terms of number of items at the lower end to avoid children with low scores;

Enjoyable for children to take (e.g. interactive, colorful materials);  

Relatively easy to adapt to various cultures;  

Easy to use in low-resource settings, e.g. not requiring much material;  

Not too difficult to obtain or too expensive;  

Able to be used in a wide age range. 


0-3 y.o.: all these assessments have sections dedicated to language but are not specifically thought to test language development only.
