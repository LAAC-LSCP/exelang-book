# Alternative / Additional tests {#alternatives}

Some people have asked us: In order to measure language in young children, what else should or could I collect? This is a complex question to answer because it depends on what you are hoping to gain from these additional tests. We have compiled here ideas from a variety of sources, and we explain the reasoning for our recommendations, but this is definitely one point in which we think discussion would be most helpful. So don't hesitate to post comments in the chat or reach out to us. 

## If you want a standardized language (or cognitive) assessment

A good starting point for this is the report by Fernald and colleagues published by the World Bank in 2009. They explain that assessments should meet a variety of desiderata. Among them is the fact that they are "psychometrically adequate, valid and reliable". We have seen validity and reliability in Video \@ref(validreli)  -- we'll add here that the situation is similar to that for LENA, in that typically the people that evaluate the validity and reliability of a tool need it to work (either because they sell the tool or they need to use it in a study). So from our point of view, often the evidence is gathered by people who have some form of a conflict of interest, and in general there is very little -- perhaps only one study with a smallish and potentially biased sample. 

In that report, they discuss instruments that are not too expensive, that are adaptable to a wide range of cultural settings, and that do not suffer from floor or ceiling effects. Floor effects emerge when the test is so hard for a given population that you cannot really measure individual differences or intervention effects because everyone is already at the lowest level they could score. Ceiling effects emerge when the items are so easy that everyone scores very well, similarly making it hard to measure variation across children or effects of an intervention.

### Children 0-3 years
For children under three years of age, there are very few options. We will discuss the subset of assessments that have sections dedicated to language, even if they are not specifically thought to test language development only. 


#### Bayley Scales of Infant Development (BSID)

Arguably, this is the most commonly used assessment of infant development in the world. There was a 4th edition released in 2019 that includes an online training and a Digital delivery option. The digital delivery concerns the administrators (there is no digital material for the child). It has been adapted to many languages.

### MacArthur Communicative Development Inventories (CDI)
CDIs are parent report forms for assessing language and communication skills in infants and young children. Most of the items are words: parents will report which among a list of words the child says (or comprehends, depending on the instrument).  It has been adapted to many languages.


#### Ages and Stages Questionnaires (ASQ)

The ASQ is a parent report, and can be completed by parents alone or administered by a trained assessor, who helps the parent understand the questions and/or decides based on observation of the child. The subscales measure skills in Communication, Gross Motor, Fine Motor, Personal-Social and Problem-Solving (similar to cognitive) domains. The third edition was published in 2009 and allows data to be managed online. At the time of writing, they are collecting data for a 4th edition.



#### Denver Developmental Screening Test (DDST)

The DDST is a comprehensive test of children’s development, and can be used to assess development from birth through 5 years of age. The Denver II was released in 1992.

#### Evaluacion de Escala de Evaluacion del Desorrollo Psicomotor (EEDP)  
The EEDP is a Spanish-language screening test initially developed in Chile and widely used in Latin America.

#### The Guide for Monitoring Child Development 
This parent report assessment provides a method for developmental monitoring and early detection of developmental difficulties in children of low and middle income countries.

### Children aged 3-5 years


#### Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test (PPVT) / Test de Imagines de Vocabulario Peabody (TVIP, in Spanish)
The PPVT (is a test of “receptive language” or listening comprehension for the spoken world and has been used in many countries throughout the world. The traditional version is a booklet with four images per page; the assessor then says the name of one of the images and the child needs to point to it. The forth edition can be administered on tablets, allowing online handling of data.

#### Reynell Developmental Language Scale
The 134-item Reynell scale (Reynell, 1990) is comprised of two subscales to assess both Receptive Language and Expressive Language. The kit includes paper material. Online you can find webinars for people who assess the test.
