[["annotation.html", "A Annotation", " A Annotation To do so, we used automated annotations derived from 500 recordings from the Bergelson dataset ((???)). Automated annotations are easy to produce in large amounts, and they allow us to derive realistic distributions of speech. For a constant annotation budget of 20 minutes per recording, we estimated the total amount of speech for each recording using only annotations extracted with two sampling strategies - random clips vs periodic (i.e. evenly spaced) clips - and different lengths of clips. This allowed us to estimate the difference between the quantities of speech estimated from 20 minutes of annotations and the true quantities.
