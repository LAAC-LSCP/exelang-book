We see three purposes for human annotation: To check accuracy of automated analyses To do things that automated analyses don’t yet do To complement with more qualitative data We provide some pointers for each of the three goals. 15.1 Checking accuracy If you are working with a population for which automated tools’ accuracy has not been checked against a human standard, it is a good idea to do some annotation to this end. We provide you with information about how to do this here. Note that if you are working with English-speaking or bilingual children in North America, there have been several validation studies, so it is probably not a good use of your resources to do yet another validation study. Before you start, we recommend a literature search starting from Cristia, Bulgarelli, &amp; Bergelson (2020)’s systematic review (in this video’s References), to make sure that there really is no reliability data for a similar sample. If no reliability studies exist, then you can use the data you have collected in a pilot or your study. Do not collect data in a different environment from the one you are aiming to use the recorder in. In particular, do not record yourself reading a book next to the recording device in a sound-proof booth. The accuracy in such a setting will tell you very little about the accuracy of the algorithms in your spontaneous, naturalistic, child-centered sample. Draw 10 clips x 2 minutes randomly from each of 10 children. This is about 3h 20min of data, which takes roughly 90h to annotate, in our experience. We recommend training annotators using the ACLEW Annotation Scheme, which has an online test annotators can go through to ensure accuracy of their own annotations. Once the manual annotations are complete, the machine annotations can be extracted and compared against the human annotations easily, provided you are using ChildProject to organize your data. We have a separate video where we introduce you to ChildProject6. In a nutshell, this will allow you to extract key classification accuracy measures used here (false alarm rate, miss rate, confusion rate and the derived identification error rate), as well as CVC, CTC, and AWC comparing LENA® and human annotations. We explain all of these terms in the video about Reliability and Validity. We insist that re-using our code is only possible “off the shelf” for manual annotations made using the ACLEW Annotation Scheme for the annotations, and ChildProject for organizing your data, although if you know how to program you can also adapt it to other schemata. 15.1.1 FAQs Some people ask us whether it shouldn’t be better to sample regions where we know the child to be talking a lot, or where there are lots of conversational exchanges between adults and the key child. A similar question is whether you cannot use annotations that you have sampled like that, for qualitative analyses, to have an idea of accuracy. If you have a limited annotation budget, of course re-using your annotations this way is better than nothing at all, but do note that if you sample your recording non-randomly, it is less certain that your conclusions based on such clips will generalize to the whole of the recording. For instance, imagine that you were trying to decide whether the child talks little or a lot based on sections that have been selected because the child talks – that would make it difficult to know because you’ve purposefully selected regions where they are talking, giving you a sort of ceiling effect. Of course, if there are no samples of a given category, then accuracy of that category cannot be evaluated; and if there are only a few, then it is possible that these are special in some way and accuracy estimates may not generalize well to others. So if the sections you end up with have no “other child” or “male” speech, then perhaps you’ll be uncertain of how well the algorithm picks up these voices. 15.2 Doing things automated analyses could do but don’t do quite well yet You may be interested in quantifying speech addressed to the key child versus to others, to separate child-directed from overheard speech; or perhaps you want to estimate the complexity of the child’s vocalizations in terms of the sounds the child produces. Both of these goals are almost within reach of automated analyses. It is likely that both can be done with fairly local information – that is, by listening to a sentence, you may be able to tell who it is spoken to. You may not need to know the whole context of the conversation. If that describes the kind of information you are hoping to extract, we strongly recommend considering to rely on citizen scientists – see the Video on 8 for information on seeking IRB approval for this, and Zooniverse for an excellent citizen science platform. There are ways of processing your data so that it can be hosted in such a platform without revealing participants’ identity or personal information. In some cases, you do need a little context – at the very least to decide whether a child vocalization is meaningful or not. At this point, this is not a task that can be solved by a machine, and in fact it takes quite some training for humans to do it reliably and replicably. If this is the kind of thing you were thinking of, we recommend looking at Mendoza and Fausey’s and Soderstrom et al’s papers in the Resources section for more ideas. 15.3 Getting complementary information You may want to get ideas of the warmth of the interactions, or the contexts in which different languages are used in a multilingual household. In this case, we recommend the work of Cychosz, Villanueva, &amp; Weisleder for more ideas. 15.4 Resources Cristia, A., Lavechin, M., Scaff, C., Soderstrom, M., Rowland, C., Räsänen, O., Bunce, J., &amp; Bergelson, E.
